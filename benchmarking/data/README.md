# Sensor Data Directory

This directory is used for benchmarking and comparing different algorithms and sampling rates.

## File Format
- All data files should be in CSV format.
- Each file should be named using the following convention:
  ```
  <patient_id>.csv
  ```
  Example:
  ```
  1234.csv
  5678.csv
  ```

## Guidelines
- Each patient should have their own CSV file.
- Ensure that data is formatted consistently for accurate processing.
